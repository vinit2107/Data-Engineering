This repository contains projects implementing data-engineering concepts like data-modeling, data-warehouse. The list below explains the projects and rationale behind the projects.

## Projects

1. **Data-Modeling**
The project aims at building a Postgres ETL pipeline using Python. It involves creating fact and dimension tables for storing data and designing an ETL pipeline that transfers data from the local system to the database using Python and Postgres. Postgres server was hosted on RDS in AWS.

2. **Data-modeling in NoSQL Database**
This project aims at building a ETL pipeline using Python and storing the data in Cassandra hosted locally. It involves creating tables in Cassandra against which the analytical queries has to be run.
